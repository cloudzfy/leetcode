## Recover Binary Search Tree

Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

Recover the tree without changing its structure.

**Note:**

A solution using O(*n*) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?

Confused what `"{1,#,2,3}"` means?

**OJ's Binary Tree Serialization:**

The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

Here's an example:

```
   1
  / \
 2   3
    /
   4
    \
     5
```

The above binary tree is serialized as `"{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}"`.
