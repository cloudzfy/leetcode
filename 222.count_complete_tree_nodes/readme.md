## Count Complete Tree Nodes

Given a **complete** binary tree, count the number of nodes.

**Definition of a complete binary tree from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees):**

In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
