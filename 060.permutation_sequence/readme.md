## Permutation Sequence

The set `[1,2,3,â€¦,n]` contains a total of *n*! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,

We get the following sequence (ie, for *n* = 3):

1. `"123"`
2. `"132"`
3. `"213"`
4. `"231"`
5. `"312"`
6. `"321"`

Given *n* and *k*, return the *k*<sup>th</sup> permutation sequence.

**Note:** Given *n* will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
