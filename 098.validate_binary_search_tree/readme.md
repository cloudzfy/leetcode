## Validate Binary Search Tree

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Confused what "{1,#,2,3}" means?

**OJ's Binary Tree Serialization:**

The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.

Here's an example:

```
   1
  / \
 2   3
    /
   4
    \
     5
```

The above binary tree is serialized as `"{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}"`.
