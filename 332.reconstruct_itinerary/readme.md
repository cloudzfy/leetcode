## Reconstruct Itinerary

Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports `[from, to]`, reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from `JFK`. Thus, the itinerary must begin with `JFK`.

**Note:**

1. If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary `["JFK", "LGA"]` has a smaller lexical order than `["JFK", "LGB"]`.
2. All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
3. You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.

**Example 1:**

`tickets` = `[["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]`

Return `["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]`.

**Example 2:**

`tickets` = `[["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]`

Return `["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]`.

Another possible reconstruction is `["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"]`. But it is larger in lexical order.
