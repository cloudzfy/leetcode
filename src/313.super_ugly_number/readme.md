## Super Ugly Number

Write a program to find the n<sup>th</sup> super ugly number.

Super ugly numbers are positive numbers whose all prime factors are in the given prime list `primes` of size `k`. For example, `[1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 19, 26, 28, 32]` is the sequence of the first 12 super ugly numbers given `primes` = `[2, 7, 13, 19]` of size 4.

**Note:**

1. `1` is a super ugly number for any given `primes`.
2. The given numbers in `primes` are in ascending order.
3. 0 < `k` ≤ 100, 0 < `n` ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>, 0 < `primes[i]` < 1000.
