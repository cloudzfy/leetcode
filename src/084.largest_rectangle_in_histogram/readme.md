Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = `[2,1,5,6,2,3]`.

![Histogram with Shaded Area](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudzfy/leetcode/master/images/histogram_area.png)

The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = `10` unit.

For example,

Given heights = `[2,1,5,6,2,3]`,

return `10`.
