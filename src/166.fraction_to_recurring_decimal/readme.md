## Fraction to Recurring Decimal

Given two integers representing the numerator and denominator of a fraction, return the fraction in string format.

If the fractional part is repeating, enclose the repeating part in parentheses.

For example,

* Given numerator = 1, denominator = 2, return "0.5".
* Given numerator = 2, denominator = 1, return "2".
* Given numerator = 2, denominator = 3, return "0.(6)".

**Hint:**

1. No scary math, just apply elementary math knowledge. Still remember how to perform a *long division*?
2. Try a long division on 4/9, the repeating part is obvious. Now try 4/333. Do you see a pattern?
3. Be wary of edge cases! List out as many test cases as you can think of and test your code thoroughly.
