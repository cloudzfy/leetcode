## Find the Duplicate Number

Given an array *nums* containing *n* + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and *n* (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Note:**

1. You **must not** modify the array (assume the array is read only).
2. You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
3. Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n<sup>2</sup>).
4. There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.
