## Find Leaves of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find all leaves and then remove those leaves. Then repeat the previous steps until the tree is empty.

**Example:**

Given binary tree 

```
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
```

Returns `[4, 5, 3], [2], [1]`.

**Explanation:**

1. Remove the leaves `[4, 5, 3]` from the tree

  ```
            1
           / 
          2          
  ```

2. Remove the leaf `[2]` from the tree

  ```
            1          
  ```

3. Remove the leaf `[1]` from the tree
  
  ```
            []         
  ```

Returns `[4, 5, 3], [2], [1]`.
