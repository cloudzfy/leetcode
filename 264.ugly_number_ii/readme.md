## Ugly Number II

Write a program to find the `n`-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include `2, 3, 5`. For example, `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12` is the sequence of the first `10` ugly numbers.

Note that `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.

**Hint:**

1. The naive approach is to call `isUgly` for every number until you reach the n<sup>th</sup> one. Most numbers are *not* ugly. Try to focus your effort on generating only the ugly ones.
2. An ugly number must be multiplied by either 2, 3, or 5 from a smaller ugly number.
3. The key is how to maintain the order of the ugly numbers. Try a similar approach of merging from three sorted lists: L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>, and L<sub>3</sub>.
4. Assume you have U<sub>k</sub>, the k<sub>th</sub> ugly number. Then U<sub>k+1</sub> must be Min(L<sub>1</sub> * 2, L<sub>2</sub> * 3, L<sub>3</sub> * 5).
